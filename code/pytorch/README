# Project Title

## Environment Requirements
- Python 3.8
- PyTorch 1.13.1
- torchvision==0.14.1

## Installation
To set up the necessary environment, follow these steps:

```bash
pip install torch==1.13.1 torchvision==0.14.1
```

## Training
To train the model, run the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

Configuration settings can be adjusted in `options.py`. This file contains various parameters and settings that you can modify to customize the training process.

## Testing
For testing the model, use the following command:

```bash
python test.py
```


## File Structure
